The lab test will involve the SIMULATION only 
of a small MIPS assembly language program. The
program, in machine code form is provided in this
directory.
 You are to modify your instruction cache of your CPU design so that
it contains this program.  Your are to use the
CPU entity given in Lab 5 to demonstrate the the functionality
of your design. 

The following entity is to be used :




library IEEE;
use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;
use IEEE.std_logic_signed.all;

entity  cpu  is
port(reset : in std_logic;
     clk   : in std_logic;
     rs_out, rt_out : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0); -- output ports from reg. file
     pc_out : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
     overflow, zero : out std_logic); -- will not be constrained in Xilinx since not enough LEDs
end cpu;



The Modelsim DO file cpu_labtest.do is to be used to perform
the simulation.


You are NOT required to download the synthesized design to the
XUPV2Pro board as part of the lab test.  

You ARE required to synthesize your entire CPU containing the
machine code of the lab test program .


Submit the following:

1. The precision.log file
2. The top-level VHDL code containing the datapath  - control unit
   and the I-cache
3. Simulation results.

WRITE YOUR NAME ON ALL PAPERS TO BE SUBMITTED.
