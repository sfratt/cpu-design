The lab quiz will involve the execution of
a small MIPS assembly language program. The
program, in machine code form will be provided
to you during the lab test. You are to modify
your instruction cache of your CPU design so that
it contains this program.  Your are to use the
CPU entity given in Lab 5 to demonstrate the the functionality
of your design.  The following UCF file is to be used:


CONFIG STEPPING="0";

NET pc_out(3) LOC = AA5 ;
NET pc_out(2) LOC = AA6;
NET pc_out(1) LOC = AC3;
NET pc_out(0) LOC = AC4;

NET reset LOC = N5;
NET clk LOC = T4 ;

NET rs_out(3) LOC = P2 ;
NET rs_out(2) LOC = R7;
NET rs_out(1) LOC = P4;
NET rs_out(0) LOC = T2;

NET rt_out(3) LOC = R5;
NET rt_out(2) LOC = R3;
NET rt_out(1) LOC = V1;
NET rt_out(0) LOC = T6;
